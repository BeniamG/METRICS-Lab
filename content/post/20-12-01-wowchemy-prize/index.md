Their talk, titled [_Speaking for Sociology (and the social sciences): Computational Text Analysis of a Century of Presidential Addresses to the Disciplines_](https://isaconf.confex.com/isaconf/wc2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/146274), fit well into a pannel titled _Theories and Methods in Undertaking Histories of Sociology_ which was chaired by Marcel Fournier and Natalia Maystorovich Chulio.

Their presentation reviewed the challenges and opportunities for combining computational and human coding on creatively selected bespoke historical datasets. The Presidential Addresses to the Social Sciences corpus was presented as a exemplary case of the role of *medium data* in advancing the objectives social scientific inquiry by exploring the boundries between human and machine coding of text docuemnts.
